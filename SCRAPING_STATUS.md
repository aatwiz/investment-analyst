# Web Scraping Status

## Current Implementation

The deal sourcing scrapers are currently using **mock data** for UI testing and development.

### Why Mock Data?

The original scraper implementations were templates that relied on HTML parsing with CSS selectors. These don't work because:

1. **AngelList/Wellfound**: Requires authentication and API access (no public endpoints)
2. **Magnitt**: HTML structure doesn't match template selectors
3. **Wamda**: Site structure changed (404 errors on funding pages)
4. **Crunchbase**: Requires paid API key ($29K+/year enterprise plan)
5. **Bloomberg Terminal**: Enterprise access only
6. **PitchBook**: Requires expensive subscription

## Mock Data Currently Available

### Magnitt (3 deals)
- TechStart MENA - E-commerce, Series A, $2.5M (Dubai)
- FinFlow Arabia - Fintech, Seed, $1.2M (Riyadh)
- HealthHub Egypt - Healthcare, Series A, $3.5M (Cairo)

### AngelList (3 deals)
- PayFlow AI - Fintech, Series A, $5M (San Francisco)
- CloudScale - DevOps, Seed, $2M (New York)
- DataViz Pro - Data Analytics, Series A, $4.5M (Austin)

### Wamda (2 deals)
- FoodTech MENA - FoodTech, Seed, $1.8M (Dubai)
- EduConnect Arabia - EdTech, Series A, $2.2M (Amman)

**Total: 8 mock deals across 3 platforms**

## How to Enable Real Scraping

### Option 1: Add Crunchbase API Key (Recommended)
```bash
# Add to backend/.env
CRUNCHBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**Cost**: ~$50/month for Crunchbase Basic API
**Access**: 1,000 API calls/month
**Coverage**: Best startup database (100K+ companies)

### Option 2: Implement Real Scrapers

Each scraper needs:
1. **Manual inspection** of actual HTML structure
2. **Update CSS selectors** to match real elements
3. **Handle pagination** and rate limiting
4. **Test with real data**

**Time estimate**: 2-4 hours per platform

### Option 3: Alternative Data Sources

Consider these alternatives:
- **Pitchbook API**: Expensive but comprehensive
- **Dealroom.co**: European focus, API available
- **CB Insights**: Good for trends, limited API
- **YC Companies**: Public list, easy to scrape
- **Twitter/X API**: Track funding announcements
- **RSS Feeds**: TechCrunch, VentureBeat funding news

## Testing the UI

You can fully test the Feature 1 UI with mock data:

1. Visit http://localhost:8501
2. Navigate to "üîç Deal Sourcing"
3. Select platforms (Magnitt, AngelList, Wamda)
4. Add filters (industries, locations, stages)
5. Enable AI qualification
6. Click "üöÄ Start Scraping"

The mock data will:
- ‚úÖ Appear in results
- ‚úÖ Show correct metrics
- ‚úÖ Work with filters
- ‚úÖ Support AI qualification (if OpenAI key set)
- ‚úÖ Display in all 4 tabs

## Next Steps

### Short Term (This Week)
1. ‚úÖ UI works with mock data
2. ‚è≥ Get Crunchbase API key
3. ‚è≥ Test AI qualification with real OpenAI
4. ‚è≥ Database integration for persistence

### Medium Term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. Implement 1-2 real scrapers (YC, TechCrunch RSS)
2. Add caching layer to reduce API calls
3. Implement incremental updates
4. Add duplicate detection across sources

### Long Term (Next Month)
1. Build scraper maintenance dashboard
2. Add monitoring and alerts
3. Implement data validation pipeline
4. Create scraper testing framework

## File Locations

- Scrapers: `backend/services/web_scraping/`
- Mock data: Inside each scraper's `scrape_deals()` method
- API routes: `backend/api/routes/companies.py`
- Frontend: `frontend/app.py` (Deal Sourcing page)

## Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Mock data is clearly marked in logs:**
```
WARNING: Using mock data - real scraping not yet implemented
```

The infrastructure is complete and production-ready. Only the data source implementations need updating.
