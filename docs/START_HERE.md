## 🚀 How Your Colleague Should Start

### Step 1: Read the Docs (15 minutes)
```
1. docs/PROJECT_STATUS_AND_ROADMAP.md  ← Start here!
2. docs/FEATURE_INTEGRATION_MAP.md     ← Visual guide
3. backend/services/[feature]/README.md ← Specific feature details
```

### Step 2: Test What Works (5 minutes)
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start backend
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000

# Terminal 2: Start frontend  
streamlit run frontend/app.py

# Upload a document → Select "LLM-Powered" → See the magic! ✨
```

### Step 3: Pick a Feature to Build
**Recommended Order**:
1. **Feature 1** (Deal Sourcing) - Most impactful, uses LLM agent
2. **Feature 3** (Market Analysis) - Extends LLM capabilities
3. **Feature 4** (Financial Modeling) - Complex but valuable
4. **Feature 5** (Memo Generation) - Aggregates everything

  ↳ Keyword extraction patterns
  ↳ Red flag detection
  ↳ Can be extended for market data extraction

backend/services/file_processing/file_processor.py
  ↳ Multi-format document parsing
  ↳ Reuse for scraped documents, reports, Excel models
```

### Ready to Implement (Start here):
```
backend/services/web_scraping/scraper_base.py
  ↳ Base class complete with rate limiting
  ↳ Just add scraping logic to subclasses

backend/services/deal_qualification/scoring_engine.py
  ↳ Structure ready
  ↳ Integrate with investment_analyst_agent.py

## 🎯 Development Workflow

### For Each Feature:
1. **Service Layer** (1 week)
   - Implement core logic in `backend/services/[feature]/`
   - Use existing patterns from Feature 2
   - Write tests

2. **API Layer** (2 days)
   - Add endpoints in `backend/api/routes/`
   - Follow FastAPI conventions
   - Test with curl/Postman

3. **Frontend** (2 days)
   - Add page in `frontend/pages/` or extend `app.py`
   - Use Streamlit components
   - Test end-to-end

4. **Documentation** (1 day)
   - Update service README
   - Add usage examples
   - Document integration points

## 💡 Pro Tips for Your Colleague

### Reuse Everything!
- ✅ Copy LLM prompt patterns from `investment_analyst_agent.py`
- ✅ Use document_analyzer patterns for data extraction
- ✅ Leverage file_processor for any document handling
- ✅ Same async/await patterns everywhere

### Don't Reinvent the Wheel
```python
# Good ✅
from services.llm_agents import InvestmentAnalystAgent
agent = InvestmentAnalystAgent()
result = await agent.analyze_document(...)

# Bad ❌
# Don't create a new OpenAI client from scratch
# Don't write new prompt patterns if you can adapt existing
```

### Test Incrementally
- Build one scraper at a time
- Test each service independently
- Integrate with frontend last
- Use the API docs at `localhost:8000/docs`
